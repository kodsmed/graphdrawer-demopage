# jk224jv-graphdrawer-demopage

This is a demo page for the graphdrawer web component, found in the components/graphdrawer folder.
The graphdrawer is a web component that draws a graph from an array of numbers using the canvas element.

A live version of this demo page can be found at [https://graphdrawerdemo.netlify.app/](https://graphdrawerdemo.netlify.app/)

You can use this demo page as a starting point for your own project... in that case you can just clone this repo and start coding.
'It's my repo but you fork if I want to'... Im fairly sure that is what Abba sang.

Or you can get the stand-alone component [https://github.com/kodsmed/graphdrawer](https://github.com/kodsmed/graphdrawer)

## Usage

Clone the repo to your local machine.

Navigate to the root folder of the project and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

The demo page is located in the src folder, and is called index.html.
