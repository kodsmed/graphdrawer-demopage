You can use this demo page as a starting point for your own project... in that case you can just clone this repo and start coding.
'It's my repo but you clone if you want to'... Im fairly sure that is what Abba sang.

Or you can get the stand-alone component [https://github.com/kodsmed/graphdrawer](https://github.com/kodsmed/graphdrawer)

## Usage

Clone the repo to your local machine.

Navigate to the root folder of the project and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

The demo project comes pre-configured with vite, so you can run `npm run dev` to launch a local webbserver and preview the demo page.
The demo page is located in the src folder, and is called index.html.
